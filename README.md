# FFNeuralNetwork_LEGOS
Designed a FeedForward Neural Network from ground up without use of preexisting libraries such as PyTorch, Keras, Tensor Flow etc.  This included the development of a Feedforward function used to run through training data and test new data sets. This also included a Backpropogation algorithm used to adjust weights and biases for better performance. Optimized Network to have an accuracy of 80% and rising when identifying 10 unique lego blocks.
